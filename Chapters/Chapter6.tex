\chapter{Conclusion and Recommendations}

In this study we attempted to evaluate recent GRACE/GOCE models on Sudan. Our aim of this study was never to develop a new datum for Sudan, but rather to exhaustively try different models on our study area. Interestingly, our results--even without any corrections--our results are comparable to that reported by \citep{ahmed_msc, godah}. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item We begun our study by collecting terrestrial data for our study area
	\item GeoidApp: A software application that is mainly developed to help researchers evaluate different degrees of the model. The whole process is fully automated.
	\item The whole process of visualization, statistical analysis, reports are all handled within GeoidApp, and stored in their corresponding directories.
\end{itemize}
