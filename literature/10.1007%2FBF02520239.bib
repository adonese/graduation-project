abstract="Vertical datum definition is identical with the choice of a potential (or height) value for the fundamental bench mark. Also the connection of two adjacent vertical datums poses no principal problem as long as the potential (or height) value of two bench marks of the two systems is known and they can be connected by levelling. Only the unification of large vertical datums and the connection of vertical datums separated by an ocean remains difficult.",
